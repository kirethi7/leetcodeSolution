Problem Statement
Given an array of characters chars, compress it using the following algorithm:

Begin with an empty string s. For each group of consecutive repeating characters in chars:

If the group's length is 1, append the character to s.
Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.
The compressed string s should not be returned separately, but instead, be stored in the input character array chars. Note that group lengths that are 10 or longer will be split into multiple characters in chars.

After you are done modifying the input array, return the new length of the array.

You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
Explanation: The groups are "aa", "bb", and "ccc". This compresses to "a2b2c3".
Example 2:

Input: chars = ["a"]
Output: Return 1, and the first character of the input array should be: ["a"]
Explanation: The only group is "a", which remains uncompressed since it's a single character.
Example 3:

Input: chars = ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]
Output: Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].
Explanation: The groups are "a" and "bbbbbbbbbbbb". This compresses to "ab12".









Solution in Java

class Solution {
    public int compress(char[] chars) {
        int i =0,j= 1,count = 1;
        StringBuffer str = new StringBuffer();
        if(chars.length == 1){
            return 1;
        }
        while( i < j && j < chars.length){
            if(chars[i] == chars[j] ){
                count++;
            }
            else if(chars[i] != chars[j] && count == 1){
                str.append(chars[i]);
                i++;
            }
            else {
                str.append(chars[i]);
                str.append(count);
                count = 1;
                i = j;
            }
            j++;
        }
        str.append(chars[i]);
        if(count > 1)
        str.append(count);
        for (int k =0 ;k< str.length();k++) {
                    chars[k] = str.charAt(k);
                }
        return str.length();
    }
}




Approach : 
So basically we are changing the original array itself
so whenever the pointers moving adjacently had different characters then we are storing the character as well as the count in a string buffer, which we later iterate over the original array.
Here the return type is the length of the string buffer so that i gets automatically print the original array according to the length.
IF there is only one character then count need not to be done for that and only the single character addition would be fine.
